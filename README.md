### Avoiding the Escape Key

Regularly reaching for the escape key in Vim can lead to pinky strain (ouch)!
Remap  to avoid the stretching  and keep your fingers on the home row.

    :imap jj

This allows you to press `jj` to exit from insert mode.  The `:imap` command is
used to create the mapping so that it only applies while in insert mode.  The
pair of characters "jj" occurs very rarely in English, so using it won't
interfere with normal typing

To type "jj" without triggering escape, just wait a couple seconds between each
character.

### Instantly preview Markdown from Vim

Want to instantly preview finnicky markdown files, but don't want to leave your
favorite editor, or have to do it in some crappy browser textarea?
**vim-instant-markdown** is your friend! When you open a markdown file in vim, a
browser window will open which shows the compiled markdown in real-time, and
closes once you close the file in vim.

As a bonus,
[github-flavored-markdown](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/)
is supported, and styles used while previewing are the same as those github
uses!

### Use a Vim-style editor in XCode

Sometimes IDEs are a necessary evil.  For OO languages and large APIs
or codebases, they can be especially useful.  And XCode has some great features
for building stunning UIs.  But you don't have to give up your the speed and
efficiency of your favorite editor, Vim!

Install the **XVim plugin** and get a rich set of vim features and keybindings
right inside XCode's editor.

## Manage Vim plugins with Vundle

Automatically manage all of your vim plugins and scripts with Vundle, a plugin
manager for Vim.  Gone are the days of manually downloading, extracting and
installing files into `~/.vim`.  Vundle makes installing, updating and
configuring all your plugins simple.  Just refer to each plugin's GitHub repo in
your `~/.vimrc`

### Range Operators

Use the range operators to simplify for loop syntax.  You can keep an index in a
loopâ€”either by using `..<` to make a range of indexes or by writing an explicit
initialization, condition, and increment. These two loops do the same thing:

    var firstForLoop = 0
    for i in 0..<4 {
      firstForLoop += i
    }
    print(firstForLoop)

    var secondForLoop = 0
    for var i = 0; i < 4; ++i {
      secondForLoop += i
    }
    print(secondForLoop)


Use `..<` to make a range that omits its upper value, and use `...` to make
a range that includes both values.

Mount an Android device on the back of a two-way mirror to display date,
time, weather, birthday reminders, chore reminders, stock prices, XKCD, etc.

## cURL

###Word Definitions from the Command Line

You can use cURL to get the definition for a word with the help of the DICT protocol. Just pass a Dictionary Server URL to it and the word you want the definition for. 

    $curl dict://dict.org/d:genesis

The above command will list the definition for genesis as follows: 

    "genesis" gcide "The Collaborative International Dictionary of English v.0.48" Genesis \Gen"e*sis\, n. [L., from Gr. ge'nesis, fr. the root of gi'gnesqai to geget, be born; akin to L. genus birth, race. See {Gender}. ]

    [1913 Webster]

    1. the act of producing, or giving birth or origin to anything. 

###Customize cURL's Output

Normally, when you use cURL you use the command

    $curl -IL "ulr"

The above command would send a HEAD request (-I), follow all redirects (-L), and display some useful information: 

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Date: Mon, 14 Sep 2015 08:57:17 GMT
    Expires: -1
    Cache-Control: private, max-age=0
    Content-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1
    P3P: CP="This is not a P3P policy! See http://www.google.com/support/accounts/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=151657 for more info."

    Transfer-Encoding: chunked
    Accept-Ranges: none
    Vary: Accept-Encoding

But what if you're only interested in a subset of the standard cURL output? cURL provides special variables for customizing output. The following command only prints the http status code of the request and redirects curl's HTML output to /dev/null. 

    $curl -sL -w "%{http_code} % {url_effective} \\n" "URL" -o /dev/null

The above command results in the following output: 

    200 HTTP://www.google.com/

Here are the other special variables available in case you want to customize the output some more. 

    url_effective, http_code, http_connect, time_total, time_namelookup, time_connect, time_pretransfer, time_redirect, time_starttransfer, size_download, size_upload, size_header, size_request, speed_download, speed_upload, content_type, num_connects, num_redirects, ftp_entry_path

###Open Source Projects

##Neovim - Next Generation Vim Text Editor 

The Vim text editor has been loved by a generation of users. We're aggressively refactoring Vim to ensure it stays relevant in the future. 

**More Powerful Plugins**
Neovim is rebuilding the plugin architecture from the ground up to provide a system that allows for extensions in any language and will be backwards compatible with your old plugins. 

**Better GUI Architecture**
Neovim will focus on providing a headless text editing environment. This will allow any GUI to be written that ties into the native GUI of whatever os it is running on. 

**First Class Support for Embedding**
Any program will be able to include NeoVim commands right in the application.
